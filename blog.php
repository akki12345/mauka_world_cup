        <h2>‘Mauka Mauka’ on IPL, Chris Gayle and India-WI clash.</h2>
        <p>            
          In some way, it is also building up to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting in April. But the humour lies in the fact how West Indian cricketers depend on IPL to earn their living.

Or maybe it meant: “You better stick to IPL. World Cup is our game.”

        <h2>Again 300 plus scored and easily chased by Bangladesh.</h2>
        <p>            
          t was surprising after winning the TOSS Bangladesh opted to field first. And when Scotland came to bat
it seem they were in full form as they really wanted to bat first.Kyle Coetzer scored 156 of 134 balls with 17- 4’s and 4 – 6’s, his batting was worth watching. When Calum got out for 11 runs, Hamish took the charge. But Hamish also lost his wicket at a low score of 19 runs. Later Matt, Preston and lower order joined Kyle but no one could score more than 40 runs. But Scotland still manage to score a victory total of 318 runs at a loss of 8 wickets in 50 Overs.

        <h2>What A Remarkable Win by South Africa</h2>
        <p>South Africa won the toss and elected to bat. As usual Quinton de Kock (wk) who is going from a bad batting phase lost his wicket at 1 run. But then Amla and Plessis played their much awaited innings by South African fans. Both scored hundred’s. Amla scored 159 runs in 128 balls (including 16 – 4’s and 4 – 6’s). After Amla and Plessis captain AB de Villiers (c) scored 24 runs for 9 balls. South Africa’s top order really played very well and set a total of 411 for Ireland at a loss of 4 wickets. After lunch Ireland team came to bat. To chase a high score leads to mental pressure; this could be easily seen on faces of Ireland team. They started losing wickets very quickly. Andrew and Kevin did play good but a score of 411 is a huge chasing total even for a very experienced team. Ireland was all out at 210 in 45 over’s and South Africa won the 2nd consecutive 1 day match today by 211 runs. </p>
